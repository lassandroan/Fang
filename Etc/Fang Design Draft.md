## Rendering

### World

#### Geometry

- Raycast renderer to draw world geometry
- Tiles can have variable heights, but only one texture per tile
- Tile height in increments of the grid size only
- Tiles can have 4 side textures, a top texture, and a bottom texture
- Tiles can support transparent textures

#### Entities

- Drawn using billboard sprites
- Sprites are directional and animated
- Used for players, enemies, pickups, projectiles, and lights

#### Particles

- Used for blood splatter, bullet hits, smoke, gibs, etc.
- Can collide with geometry but not with entities

#### Decals

- Particles or projectiles hitting a surface draw into special textures that are rendered over top of the floor / walls

### Lighting

- Fog based on ray distance
- Per tile lighting
- Textures / sprites are lit using the light intensity for the tile they're in

### Fonts

- Monospace font map
- Ability to render using typewriter effect

### UI

- Basic interface controls such as buttons, sliders, and dropdowns
- Immediate-mode style interface

## Audio

- Directional audio
- Audio effects such as reverb and echo
- Possible support for text to speech

## Editing

- 2D level editor
- Set walls / entities / lights
- Can swap between gameplay / editing
- Potential for editing while in game mode ("3D")

## Debugging

### Console

- Similar to Source engine etc, bring up with '/'
- Commands built into game engine

### Input Recording

- Key to start/stop recording
- Grabs initial frame update data, then records input events until stopping
- Held in memory and replays until button pressed again
